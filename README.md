## 🤔 Why Scrape the Apify Store?

The Apify Store is a growing marketplace for web scraping and automation tools. By extracting data systematically, you can:

4. **View your results** in the Dataset tab or download as JSON, CSV, or Excel

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### 🔄 Resuming Failed Runs

The actor features built-in state persistence. If a run fails or gets migrated, it will automatically resume from where it left off, saving you time and resources.

### 🔍 Multiple Search Terms

Use the `search` array to process multiple queries in a single run. Each term will be processed sequentially, with results combined in the final dataset.

### ⏱️ Rate Limiting

The `batchDelay` parameter helps you control how aggressively the actor makes requests. Higher values are more conservative but slower, while lower values are faster but may increase the risk of temporary blocks.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- The actor only extracts publicly available information from the Apify Store
- Request rates are limited to respect Apify's servers
- Some detailed actor statistics may not be available for all listings
